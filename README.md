### Prerequisites

- hyprland for window decorations
- aylur's gtk shell
- ADW-GTK3 WITH THEME SET TO DARK (don't be like me troubleshooting for 3 hour on new install lol)
  
### Installation

Clone this repository and copy the files into your ~/.config folder :D

Launch the topbar with ags in your terminal, or press alt + r (defined in hyprland.conf) to bring up the applauncher and subsequently start the ags process

BE CAREFUL about overwriting your own dotfiles, I have custom keybinds (and you probably will have keybinds you are overwriting. Remember to back up your config files before overwriting them with mine!
